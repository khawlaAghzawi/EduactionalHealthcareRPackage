## EHR Data

Welcome to the first topic of our tutorial, where we will dive into the 
implementation of the ehr_module.R file, which contains functions for analyzing
and visualizing Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. 
This module is a crucial component of our package, designed to provide users 
with powerful tools for gaining insights from their healthcare datasets.

Let's start by understanding the analyze_ehr_data function. 
This function is designed to analyze EHR data stored in a CSV file. 
Here's a breakdown of its usage:

```{r analyze_ehr_data, exercise=TRUE}
# replace the file path with your local path
ehr_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/synthetic_ehr_data.csv")
analyze_ehr_data(ehr_data)
```


It takes a file path to a dataset in CSV format as its parameter and performs a 
series of analyses, including checking for required columns, reading the dataset,
displaying the number of observations, and providing summary statistics.


The second helper function in this module is visualize_ehr_data. 
It is dedicated to creating visualizations that help users explore the 
relationships between age and diseases in their EHR dataset. The preprocessed
EHR data is its input.
It performs checks for required columns, missing values, and the uniqueness of
values in the Diagnosis column before generating various plots, including 
histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots, to visualize the distribution of age
and its relationship with gender and diagnosis.

```{r visualize_ehr_data, exercise=TRUE}
ehr_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/synthetic_ehr_data.csv")
visualize_ehr_data(ehr_data)
```

## Clinical Trial

Efficient functions for processing clinical trial data and getting an insight 
are `load_clinical_trial_data`, `analyze_clinical_trial_data` and `preprocess_clinical_trial_data`.

```{r load_preprocess_and_analyze_clinical_trial_data, exercise=TRUE}
# replace the file path with your local path
clinical_trial_data <- load_clinical_trial_data("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/clinical_trial_data.csv")
clinical_trial_data <- preprocess_clinical_trial_data(clinical_trial_data)
analyze_clinical_trial_data(clinical_trial_data)
```


```{r perform_hypothesis_test, exercise=TRUE}
clinical_trial_data <- load_clinical_trial_data("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/clinical_trial_data.csv")
clinical_trial_data <- preprocess_clinical_trial_data(clinical_trial_data)
perform_hypothesis_test(clinical_trial_data)
```

We can interpret the outcome as follows: 
With a p-value of 0.7127, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null 
hypothesis of independence between the variables. In other words, based on the
provided data and the chosen significance level (usually 0.05), we do not have
statistically significant evidence to conclude that there is a relationship 
between the two categorical variables.

The last function in this module is about visualizing the clinical trial data:

```{r visualize_clinical_trial_data, exercise=TRUE}
clinical_trial_data <- load_clinical_trial_data("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/clinical_trial_data.csv")
clinical_trial_data <- preprocess_clinical_trial_data(clinical_trial_data)
visualize_clinical_trial_data(clinical_trial_data)
```


## Predictive Models

The functions in this module provide a framework for building, evaluating, and
utilizing predictive models in the context of healthcare data, particularly for
predicting patient outcomes. The following example usage demonstrates how these functions 
can be applied in a real-world scenario.

```{r predictive_models_functions, exercise=TRUE}
# reading datasets
training_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/synthetic_training_data.csv")
testing_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/synthetic_test_data.csv")
new_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/synthetic_new_data.csv")

# Build predictive model
trained_model <- build_predictive_model(training_data)
print("Trained Predictive Model:")
print(trained_model)

# Evaluate the model
evaluation_result <- evaluate_predictive_model(trained_model, testing_data)
print("Evaluation Result (RMSE):")
print(evaluation_result)

# Make predictions
predictions <- make_predictions(trained_model, new_data)
print("Predictions:")
print(predictions)
```

Interpretation of this example: 
- The linear regression model was trained on the training data and evaluated on
the testing data.
- The RMSE value in the training phase is 16.41463, suggesting the average 
prediction error is around this value.
- After evaluating on the testing data, the RMSE is 15.72453, indicating the 
model's performance on unseen data.
- Predictions for new data points are provided. For instance, the model predicts
outcomes for data points 1 to 5.


## Medical Imaging

This module provides an overview of loading, preprocessing, segmentation, and 
object detection using the provided functions.

```{r image_segmentation, exercise=TRUE}
# loading medical imaging data
path1 <- "C:/Users/User/Desktop/EduHlth/data/synthetic_xray_image.png"
medical_imaging_data <- load_medical_imaging_data(path1)
 
preprocess_medical_imaging_data(medical_imaging_data)     

# simple thresholding of value 0.5 for demonstration purposes. Edit it according to your needs
perform_image_segmentation(path1)
```

The image segmentation process was successful, and the result is considered as TRUE.
In this case, a simple thresholding operation was performed, and pixels with 
values greater than 0.5 were likely considered part of one segment, while those 
with values less than or equal to 0.5 were considered part of another segment.
